### **FAQ**

#### **DONATIONS**
 
##### 1. What percentage of my donation goes to the charities supported by President’s Challenge?  
100% of donations to President's Challenge go towards the supported charities chosen by the President’s Challenge.  

##### 2. Who covers the operating costs of President's Challenge?  
The operating costs of President’s Challenge are covered by a grant from Singapore Totalisator Board as a community initiative so that every dollar donated to President's Challenge go to the charities we support. 

##### 3. How can I be an anonymous donor?  
Let us know your request to remain anonymous and we will respect your request. 

##### 4. How much tax deductions do I qualify for when I make a donation? 
All outright cash donations given by individuals or corporations to charities with tax-deductible status will be entitled to tax deductions. From 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, donors are entitled to 250% tax deduction for qualifying donations. Therefore, if you give $100 to a charity, you will be entitled to tax deduction for the amount of $250. For more information on tax deductions, visit [www.iras.gov.sg](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/default.aspx)

##### 5. Will I receive a tax deductible receipt for my donation? 
In support of green efforts to save the environment, we will not be issuing any receipts for donation unless upon request. Regardless of your donation amount, we will help to submit your tax deduction to IRAS as long as you provide your Singapore identification number when making a donation. 

##### 6. How do I claim for my tax deductions without a tax deductible receipt? 
If you have provided your identification number when you made a donation to President’s Challenge, we will help you make the submission to IRAS. Hence, you will not need the receipt when submitting your annual tax assessment. If you are an individual donor, IRAS now automatically acknowledges the tax-deductible status of your donations if the charity submits your identification number to IRAS on your behalf. 

##### 7. Will my organisation receive a tax deduction or does each of us get individual tax deductions for our donation? 
If the donation was made on your organisation’s behalf, your company will qualify for tax deduction. Individual donors get the tax deduction if the individual donor’s donation was from a fundraising event or exercise. In such a case, your organisation will only receive a receipt of acknowledgement for the contribution. 

##### 8. Does President’s Challenge sell, rent or trade donor information (eg. mailing and email addresses and phone numbers) to other agencies? 
The privacy of our donors is very important to us and we do not share or sell this information.

##### 4. When is the application window for PC-ELF?
PC-ELF and PC share the same application window. The application window typically opens in August and agencies are given six weeks to apply.

Agencies will be informed of the application outcome by Feb/Mar 2020 via a letter from the President’s Office.

In May 2020, Agencies will be informed of the range of funds allocated to the programme via email. The definitive amount is not given as the programmes’ funding is dependent on the funds raised during the year.

##### 8. Are we allowed to apply for only 1 or 2 years of funding?

##### 10. Why do we only receive the funds for PC-ELF 1.5 years after I had applied?
E.g. for PC-ELF 2020
After the PC-ELF application window has closed, NCSS will assess the applications and thereafter, submit to President’s Office to review and confirm the list of benefitting agencies for the year. Fund-raising will be conducted for the whole of 2020 till early 2021. The funding amounts will then be confirmed based on the fund raised, and thus only disbursed to agencies in Jun 2021.

##### 11. Are agencies expected to commence the projects applied in PC20 in 2020, before funds are disbursed?
Agencies should start their programme once the supported areas and funding have been communicated in March 2020. In June 2021, agencies will receive the first year’s disbursement and will be informed of the confirmed funding amount for the programme duration.

##### 12. When will the funds for Y2 and Y3 be disbursed?
The funds for Y2 and Y3 will be disbursed in June 2022 and 2023, respectively, contingent upon the annual submission of the required reports to NCSS, as well as the programme performance.

##### 13. Will we receive the exact amount requested from PC-ELF?
Funding will be subject to the strength of justifications in the use of resources and outcomes to be achieved in the proposal.

##### 14. What happens if we do not fully utilise the funding we are provided with?
PC-ELF funding must be utilised by the Agencies within three (3) years from the date of the first disbursement for the purposes it was approved for. If funds are not expended within the specified time frame, NCSS has the sole discretion to grant an extension for the period of fund usage or to claw back the unutilised funds.

##### 15. Are agencies allowed to fund-raise for their programmes that are supported by PC-ELF?
Yes, Agencies can fund-raise for any shortfall/components of the programme not covered by PC-ELF funding.

##### 16. What are the reporting requirements of PC-ELF?
An annual reporting template will be provided to supported agencies for the reporting of the programmes outcomes. The report has to be submitted by August at the end of each programme year. 

The agency is also required to submit the programme’s certified income and expenditure statement, as well as its annual audited financial statements at its earliest availability. The audited financial statement should classify the PC-ELF funds as a restricted fund. If the Programme is receiving different sources of funding for the purposes of operating the Programme, it should be itemised and disclosures on the funding should be included.
