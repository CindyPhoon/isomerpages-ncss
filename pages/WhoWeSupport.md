### WHO WE SUPPORT

![Beneficiary Banner](/images/our-beneficiary.jpg "Beneficiary Banner")

Every year, our community outreach and fundraising campaign selects a large number of benefitting organisations to support and raise funds for so that they can focus on their mission and cause.  President's Challenge's support covers various sectors from children & family services, healthcare & eldercare, disability services and rehabilitation of ex-offenders.
