	<b>Centre for Seniors’</b> Inclusive and Inter-Generational Work Team programme aims to develop sustainable employment for people with special needs, supported by trained seniors at workplace settings for targeted job opportunities. By pairing older workers with young adults with special needs in workforce, the programme creates opportunities for these two groups of people that would otherwise not exist by allowing employers to focus on what workers with significant and multiple disabilities can do rather than penalising them for what they can’t do.<br><br>
 
Sixty-six-year-old Magdelene is a senior programme coordinator who has been paired with 21-year-old Chee Yong, who specialises in IT and works at Centre For Seniors. As Chee Yong has difficulties multi-tasking, Magdelene helps him every morning by going through the tasks scheduled for the day. Helping him to prioritise his work and plan his time has helped him feel less overwhelmed about working in the office.<br><br>
 
Magdelene shared, “It is certainly a good learning experience for me.  Overtime, I am able to understand and communicate with him better.  Patience and empathy are the key factors.”</td></tr></table>

Twemty-two-year-old Jeremy Har was diagnosed with autism when he was six years old. He attended Northlight School and went on to Mountbatten Vocational School until he graduated in 2015. After graduation, his parets approached Autism Resource Centre (Singapore)'s Adult Employability & Employment Centre (E2C) for help. He was enrolled in the Sewing and Embroidery Class where he learnt the skill of craft making which helped him earn an income for the products he made. In time E2C hopes that Jeremy will eventually progress to open employment.<br><br>

Said Jeremy's mother, Mrs Har: "The programme has provided Jeremy with something purposeful to do. As he has sensory disintegration and dyspraxia in addition to autism, it is difficult for him to work at high speed for long durations. This class by E2C enables Jeremy to pick up a skill to earn a living. This takes out the stress of having to work at high speed over a sustained period. <br><br>

"The sewing class also provides Jeremy with a safe and supportive learning and working environment. Coaches are very patient and caring towards Jeremy. They are also able to provide him with concise instructions to help him learn."<br><br>

This year, President's Challenge is supporting the Autism Resource Centre (Singapore)'s Sewing and Embroidery Class so that others like Jeremy will be empowered with the skills to earn a living.</td></tr></table>

“My name is Marcus Sim. I am a stroke survivor.” Forty-nine-year-old Marcus, who suffered a stroke on his left brain, suffers from a condition called aphasia, an impairment in language processing.

Today, Marcus is a different man. “It is hard,” he said, yet, he aspires to return to work.<br><br>
