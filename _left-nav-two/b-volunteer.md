The Kopitiam Diaries Programme
Through the Kopitiam Diaries Programme, the senior volunteers gather with the residents every week to chit-chat, exchange stories and belt out golden oldies over the familiar smell of kopi or local cuisine. We hope to engage committed seniors to interact with residents by befriending them, and through "Kopitiam" sessions and karaoke on a regular basis.
