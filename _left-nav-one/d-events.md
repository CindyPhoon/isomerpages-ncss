### President’s Challenge 2019 Volunteer Drive
The President’s Challenge PULSE! Sports Fiesta 2019, led by youth volunteers from the PA Youth Movement, brings fellow youths together and encourages them to give back to the community. By leveraging the energy of youth volunteers, President’s Challenge hopes to harness the collective efforts of everyone to provide an ecosystem of support to the vulnerable groups in the community.


### Start Small Dream Big (SSDB) 2018
'Start Small Dream Big' was initiated by the Early Childhood Development Agency in 2015 to celebrate SG50 and the President's Challenge's 15th anniversary. Its aim is to build an early childhood community that inculcates good values in our children and encourages them to give back to society. ECDA works with participating centres to design and implement community service projects over a period of six months. We believe that children are never too young to contribute to the community. "No one can do everything, but everyone can do something." 


### President’s Challenge Appreciation Night 2018
President Halimah Yacob hosted an appreciation night to thank the organisations and individuals, who have stepped forward and contributed to President’s Challenge in 2018.
