<td><b>Social Enterprise of the Year: </b>

Samsui Supplies & Services, initiated by the Soup Restaurant Group in 2013, provides training and employment to 100 inmates, ex-offenders, and persons with disabilities who prepare more than 1,800,000 nutritious meals for the elderly service users residing in nursing homes.

The social enterprise’s multi-pronged impact is made possible through the use of technology to enhance productivity and reduce the service users’ limitations, as well as effective job redesign at its two central kitchens within Changi Prison Complex and Enabling Village.</td></tr>
