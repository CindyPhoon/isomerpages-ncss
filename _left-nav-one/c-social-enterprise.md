####  Samsui Supplies and Services Pte Ltd
Social Enterprise of the Year: 

Samsui Supplies & Services, initiated by the Soup Restaurant Group in 2013, provides training and employment to 100 inmates, ex-offenders, and persons with disabilities who prepare more than 1,800,000 nutritious meals for the elderly service users residing in nursing homes.

The social enterprise’s multi-pronged impact is made possible through the use of technology to enhance productivity and reduce the service users’ limitations, as well as effective job redesign at its two central kitchens within Changi Prison Complex and Enabling Village.


#### Bantu Pte Ltd

Social Enterprise Start-Up of the Year: Bantu was recognised for building a proprietary cloud-based volunteer management platform called Bantu Workspace which collates volunteer data across projects, and automates critical communications and reports to improve efficiency and free up time for volunteer engagement and retention.

To date, the platform has helped 70 social organisations to manage a total of over 12,000 volunteers across more than 500 projects, while reducing administrative time by 10 percent.


#### DBS Foundation

Social Enterprise Champion of the Year (Corporate): DBS Foundation, since its inception in 2014, has nurtured over 300 social enterprises through awareness building activities, funding support, capacity building initiatives, and access to lower banking fees. The Foundation has since dedicated S$12.8 million to social enterprise grant disbursement and programme support to facilitate the sector’s continued development in Singapore. 


#### Don Wong

Social Enterprise Champion of the Year (Individual): Don Wong is the founder of the non-profit organisation, The New Charis Mission and social enterprise, The New Charis Enterprises. He has been recognised for his strong belief in the social enterprise model as a form of effective intervention and tool for people development, as well as a robust support system for the rehabilitation, training, and employment of ex-offenders.

Through his help and mentorship, many individuals have been inspired and gone on to set up their own social enterprises.
